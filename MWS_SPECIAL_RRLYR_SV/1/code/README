We include all the stars from Gaia that were classified as RR Lyrae with mean G
magnitudes between 14 and 19. Specifically that includes

1) All the stars from Gaia vari_rrlyrae table
2) All the stars from vari_classifier_result with RR* class

Here is the actual selection:

WITH x as (SELECT vari_classifier_result.source_id
        FROM gaia_dr2.vari_classifier_result
        WHERE vari_classifier_result.best_class_name::text ~~ 'RR%'::text
    UNION
    SELECT vari_rrlyrae.source_id
        FROM gaia_dr2.vari_rrlyrae)
SELECT g.* FROM gaia_dr2.gaia_source as g, x
       where g.source_id = x.source_id
       and phot_g_mean_mag between 14 and 19;
